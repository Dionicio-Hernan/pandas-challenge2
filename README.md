Findings
Gender Demographics
- In terms of gender demographics, Males comprise the large majority of players in the game, comprising 84% of the overall total unique players. 
Purchasing Analysis (Gender)
- When it comes to purchases, Males again outnumber females, comprising about 84% of the total purchases (652 vs. 113 total purchase count). Although the average purchase price for males was about $.20 lower than that of females, meaning that although males purchase on a much wider scale, females tend to spend more when they do decide to make a purchase.
Age Demographics
- Age demographic breakdowns show us that the majority of players are 20-24 years old (258/576, or 44.79%). The next highest age range was 15-19 (107/576, or 18.58%). The 25-29 age range was third highest with 77, or 13.3% (77/576*). If you add the 15-29 age range, these players comprise more than 75% of all unique players. The player count steadily decreases as you move up from age 30-40+, with a big drop around age 35. 
Purchasing Analysis (Age)
Purchasing behavior is parallel with the findings above in the age demographics in terms of average purchase price and total purchase value, with the 20-24 range coming in as the highest in the categories, followed by 15-19 and then 25-29. All three of these add up to 77% of the total purchase count. If you add in the 30-34 age range then you have a total of 87% of the total purchase count (675/680).

Summary
The gaming company should target ages 15-29 with a heavy emphasis on those between 20-24. This is where we see the highest purchase count and, purchase price and total purchase value. Ages above and below this range, while making some purchases, are highly outnumbered. I would recommend to the company that they consider also spending ad dollars/promotions targeting 30-34 year olds. While their purchase counts are lower than those from 15-29, they still comprise more than 9% of total purchase counts, which as stated above, brings your total purchase counts to 675, or 87%. 


Troubles with document submission
I have been in contact with my TA Haroon and our instructor, Hobert. Somehow I lost my virtual environment this past Wednesday, January 20. I wasn't able to troubleshoot it effectively until Saturday, January 23. This didn't allow me to start on the assignment until Saturday afternoon once class was over. Even then I have still not figured out how to submit it via Github because my virtual environment is still giving me issues. I plan to discuss with Hobert during office hours on Tuesday, January 26. Therefore I am submitting this as a .ipynb file on Github. 

Due to time constraints and not wanting to turn it in later I was not able to troubleshoot the last two problems, as well as pulling the averages for some of the data crteria.
